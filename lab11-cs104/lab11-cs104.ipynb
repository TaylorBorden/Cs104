    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a practitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answer correctly.\n",

If TT practitioners could truly feel the HEF, they would be expected to correctly identify the hand more than half of the time.\n",

    "**Question 1.7:** To begin simulating, we should start by creating a representation of Emily's model to use for our simulation. This will be an array with two items in it. The first item should be the proportion of times a TT practictioner picks the correct hand, assuming that Emily’s model was correct. The second item should be the proportion of times, under the same assumption, that the TT practitioner picks the incorrect hand. Assign `model_proportions` to this array. \n",

Use the `sample_proportions` function and assign the **proportion of correct hand choices** (out of 210) to `simulation_proportion_correct`. Lastly, use your statistic function to assign `one_statistic`  to the value of the statistic for this one simulation.\n",

Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.
